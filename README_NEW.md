# career-page-mockup (additional instructions)

This file contains usage notes and instructions for the static career page mockup.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page with job listings and an apply modal.
- `styles.css` — responsive styles for layout and components.
- `script.js` — client-side rendering, filtering, and modal behavior.

To view locally (recommended):

1. Start a simple static server from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and click `index.html`.

Notes:
- This is a static mockup. Integrate with a backend API to persist applications.
- Customize the `jobs` array inside `script.js` to change roles.
